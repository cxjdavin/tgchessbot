# About
@tgchessbot is a Telegram bot. You can play chess using @tgchessbot. To play with friends, create a group and invite @tgchessbot into it. If you wish to play alone, talk to @tgchessbot on a 1-on-1 private message.

# Hosting @tgchessbot on your own server

* Register a bot with the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
* After installing `Python3` and `pip` on a server, perform the following:

```
sudo pip3 install telepot
sudo pip3 install python-chess
sudo pip3 install Pillow
```

* Download the code from my [Github repo](https://github.com/cxjdavin/tgchessbot)
* Replace the `telegram_bot_token` variable (near the bottom of `tgchessbot.py`) with your own bot token from BotFather
* Shoot up a `screen` and run `python3 tgchessbot.py`. Detach using `Ctrl + A + D`. The bot will continue running and handle messages in the background as long as your server is up.

# Deploy with docker

* Fill .env file 
* Build and start container:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
